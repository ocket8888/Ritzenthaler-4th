This document offers clarification of commonly-misunderstood rules, not an explanation of the entire set of rules of croquet.
\end{abstract}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{If all players can agree on a set of rules - \textit{any} set of rules - then they may use those rules even if they violate these. If both teams cannot agree, the rules MUST fall back to these.}
\item Mallets are distributed in a first-come first-served order. Players must use the ball that matches the color of their mallet.
\item The exception to the above rule is in the championship match. In the championship match, those who came in first place in their previous matches must be allowed to choose mallets first. Then those who placed second will be allowed to choose mallets, and finally the third place runner-ups will be allowed to choose (if applicable). Between those who placed the same in their preliminary matches, mallets are chosen in a first-come, first-served order.
\item Typically, two or three preliminary matches are played depending on participation. To accommodate the possibility of two or three preliminaries, matches should continue until the last player is left standing, so that a strict hierarchy is formed.
\item Once a player has made it around the entire play field and once he or she has struck the starting stake, he or she is now Dead. Dead players grant no bonus strokes when struck, and can gain no bonus strokes by any means - hitting other players or going through hoops - and may pass by any path to the stake at the opposite end of the field.
\item When a Dead player strikes the opposite stake, they are now Poison. Any player that is not Poison who's ball touches a Poison ball under any circumstances instantly loses the game. A Poison player that hits another Poison player eliminates that player. A Poison player instantly loses the game if their ball goes through a hoop at any point. Whenever a Poison player eliminates a player on their turn, they gain an additional stroke.
\item When a player hits a stake that makes them Dead or Poison, their turn is over, regardless of the number of strokes they have remaining. If the stake makes a player Dead or Poison, they must place their ball anywhere they choose that is exactly a full mallet handle's length away from the stake. Placing a ball in this way does NOT count as going through a hoop, even if the line between the ball and the stake happens to go through a hoop.
\item When a player strikes a stake that does NOT make them Dead or POison, their turn is not over until they are out of strokes, and they must place the ball within one mallet HEAD length away from the stake before taking another stroke. Placing a ball in this way does NOT count as going through a hoop, even if the line between the ball and the stake happens to go through a hoop.
