# Ritzenthaler-4th
Collection of resources for the Ritzenthaler 4th of July party

## Rules
Rules are absolute. They will never change partway through the games. If you wish to make a rule change suggestion, [open an issue](https://github.com/ocket8888/Ritzenthaler-4th/issues/new), or - if you feel comfortable editing LaTeX source files - submit a pull request. The rules for each year are archived under "Releases", in case you want to go back and look at them sometime.
